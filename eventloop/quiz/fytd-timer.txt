- In eventloop/timer.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

'foo'
'baz'
'foo'
'baz'
'2 : bar'
'1 : bar'

- Program runs synchronously (Main I/O Loop)
    - 'foo' output to console immediately
    - async call with 2 added to queue
    - 'baz' output to console
    - 'foo' output to console immediately
    - async call with 1 added to queue
    - 'baz' output to console

Event Loop - after the main loop is done
- setTimeout is a call back, once main synchronous thread executes
we run things in pending callbacks
    - no I/O operation run, so event loop is run after main
    - no poll, goes to pending callbacks (which exist now)
    - Runs these in order to execute bar(2) then bar(1)

Note: run with node eventloop/timer.js
