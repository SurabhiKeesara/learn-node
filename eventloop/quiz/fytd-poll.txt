- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

Output:

foot
done
Read Error

Explanation of how this runs
- Main loop
    - someAsyncOperation
        - When we see an async method, it is pushed to poll phase
    - foo (sync)
        - executes console.log 'foo'
    - console.log (sync)
        - executes console.log 'done'

Now - The main loop is done
- We see an async I/O operation
    - Callback pushed to pending callbacks queue I/O
- Pending callback executes

- Starting the event loop delays everything
